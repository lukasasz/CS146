       <h1>About Lukas</h1> 
       <p>This is a paragraph about me. I was born in Poland, but I grew up in Brooklyn. I like to skateboard and I am
           a computer science major. I am looking forward to putting more focus and time into this course because it
           seems to be the most fun one out of my other calculus and physics classes. I have no experience with coding,
           so this might be a little challenging.
